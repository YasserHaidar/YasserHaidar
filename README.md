### ML/DL Thesis Research:

In recent years, malware development for Android mobiles has increased dramatically and Google is trying daily to limit or stop this threat on its operating system. However, not only Google is developing new techniques for detecting malicious applications, but also, malware developers are updating their techniques regularly in order to hide their malware from detection systems.

In my Master thesis, I have introduced an advanced technique for android malware detection using machine learning and deep learning techniques. A modern and big dataset is constructed and four different models are tested on this dataset and other applications. The best performance was recorded by CNN model where it reaches 99.0% on testing set and 80% on 2021 malware dataset and with short detection time.
